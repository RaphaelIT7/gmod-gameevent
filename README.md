This Project adds [gameevent.Listen](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/gameevent.Listen) to the Menu State. Currently, only the main branch of Gmod is supported.  
Current Progress:  
- gameevent.Listen works.  
- The hook gets called with the data.

ToDo:
- Some Performance improvements
- allow gameevent.Listen to be used once per Event.

Note: This Project uses [Garry's Mod Common](https://github.com/danielga/garrysmod_common)
