This Project aims to bring [gameevent.Listen](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/gameevent.Listen) to the Menu State.  
Current Progress:  
- gameevent.Listen works.  
- The hook gets called without the data. (Currently I'm too stupid to push a table.)  

Note: This Project usesÂ [Garry's Mod Common](https://github.com/danielga/garrysmod_common)
