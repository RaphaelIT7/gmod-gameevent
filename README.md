This Project adds [gameevent.Listen](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/gameevent.Listen) to the Menu State. Currently, only the main branch of Gmod is supported.  
With this module, you also get access to the [client_beginconnect](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/gameevent/client_beginconnect), [client_connect](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/gameevent/client_connected) and [server_spawn](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/gameevent/server_spawn) gameevents.  
Current Progress:  
- gameevent.Listen works.  
- The hook gets called with the data.
- allow gameevent.Listen to be used once per Event.

ToDo:
- Some Performance improvements
